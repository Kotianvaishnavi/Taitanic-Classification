The goal of this project is to develop a system using a Jupyter Notebook that predicts whether a person would survive the sinking of the Titanic. The system will utilize various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, fare, and the port of embarkation to make this prediction. The dataset used for this project is the Titanic  dataset. To start, the project involves loading the Titanic dataset into the Jupyter Notebook environment. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is then conducted to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics. Visualizations and summary statistics may be employed to gain insights into relationships between different variables and survival outcomes.Data preprocessing follows the EDA step. Missing values in the dataset are handled, and categorical variables are encoded so that they can be used in machine learning algorithms. The key features for prediction are selected, including socio-economic status (Pclass), gender (Sex), age (Age), fare (Fare), and the port of embarkation (Embarked).
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation. A machine learning model, specifically a RandomForestClassifier, is chosen for this classification task. The model is trained using the training data, learning patterns and relationships between the selected features and survival outcomes.the developed system in the Jupyter Notebook is capable of predicting whether an individual would survive the Titanic disaster. By analyzing factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, fare, and the port of embarkation, the system can provide valuable insights into the likelihood of survival.
